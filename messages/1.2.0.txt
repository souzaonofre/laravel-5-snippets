Laravel 5 Snippets for Sublime Text
https://github.com/Lykegenes/laravel-5-snippets


Version 1.2.0
********************************************************************************

#### IMPROVEMENTS

All of the snippets were cleaned up since the last release. They now all
follow PSR-2 and were updated to fully support Laravel 5.1.

The most notable changes are :
- Much better snippets to create database columns in migrations.
- Cleaned up all Helper snippets (these were a mess).
- Added missing Helper snippets.
- Added missing Request snippets.
- Added missing Storage snippets.
- Added Console snippets (there weren't any before).

Happy coding!
